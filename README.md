## How to Use?
If you would like to contribute here is how you can help:

1. Raise in Issue if you notice any errors.

2. If you would like to add content you will need to know the following.

The guide itself is written in [MultiMarkdown](http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/) syntax.
I used [Pandoc](johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) to convert the `machine-structures+markdown_mmd.md` into `machine-structures.pdf`. 

Pandoc does this via the command: 
`pandoc machine-structures+markdown_mmd.md --template=resources/guides.latex --toc --toc-depth=5 -s -o machine-structures.pdf` 

All specialized latex formating is done in the file called `guides.latex` in the `resources` directory. 

All images are in the `images` directory of the  `resources` directory. 

After you make any changes and test that it converts sucessfully into a PDF (**VERY IMPORTANT**), please raise and issue with the attached `.md` file list.
