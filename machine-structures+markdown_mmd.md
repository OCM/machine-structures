## Why This Exists
While taking my Machine Structures class I found it very difficult to conceptually understand and network the plethora of new found concepts. Thus I wrote up this brief synopsis of the concepts I found useful to understanding the core ideas. This is of course by no means **comprehensive** but I do hope it will provide you with a somewhat better understanding computer architecture. Please feel free to [email me](mailto:me@krishna.im) if you have an questions, suggestions, or corrections. Thanks and enjoy!

## Introduction
Okay, so you want to *understand* Machine Structures. But why in heaven's name to you want to take on this rather insurmountable task? I'll take a wild guess you may be forced into this by your universitiesâ€™ curriculum task force -namely your professor. Despite the pain in frustration you *may* go through as you dive deeper, believe or not the ideas in this realm are actually quite useful in your everyday life. In fact the advances we have made in machine structures in the past thirty years are the reason the internet exists in the capacity we have grown to love. Because of this progress you can use things like *parallelism* and *pipelining* run an intensive Google search in milliseconds or execute massive projects like mapping the Human Genome to tailor medical care specifically to you.

## The Big Picture
So chances are you have already tried a tiny bit of coding. But how does that virtual code turn in to physical phenomenon?  Well let's start of by defining a few ideas in the computing lexicon:

- An **Operating System (OS)** is a interface between a your program and the hardware that manages the resources and ensures you can do things like use a keyboard, store data in memory, and handle many applications at once.

- A **Scripting Language** is probably what you did or want to learn first.  Python or Ruby or Java are pretty fun examples. These scripting languages are named so because they try to look like you are writing an essay (that actually *does* cool things) in a pretty logical and shorthand script. Want to print "hello" in Python? Here it is: `` print ("hello") ``! (Beautiful isn't it?)

- A **High Level Language** is something you may or may not have written before. Lisp, C, C++ are all higher level languages. They may not be as beautiful as the Python code, but boy oh boy can you make the program run really really fast. That same hello statement from Python? Well in C it looks like:

>``     char string[] = "Hello World";``

>``     printf("%s \n", string);``

> (Now it's not as fun as before.)


- A **Compiler** is a program that parses (goes through) your complex C or C++ code and turns it into something that's harder for you to read, but easier for a computer to read. FYI though, a **compiler** is an umbrella term that can also mean turning that beautiful Python code to a more complicated C version, but more generally used to mean from C to an Assembly Language.

- An **Assembly Language** is the output from the compiler and looks like a funky short fragments such as:

> `` multi $t2 $t1 4 ``

> Don't worry if you don't understand what the above means. It is written in a language called **MIPS** that we will discuss later. It is worth mentioning that Intel has a very popular assembly language called **x86**, which can get quite complex and unfortunately will not be discussed in much detail in this guide.

- An **Instruction** is each one of those funky little fragments from the compiler.
 
- An **Assembler** is yet another program that takes in the assembly language and interprets that into something the *CPU* can read and execute.  
 
- The **Machine Language** is the output from the assembler looks quite intimidating. Here is an example of what adding two things looks like:

> `` 1000110010100000 ``

> Yep! You guessed it. It's binary! The CPU's structure (discussed lated) need the format to be in just 1's and 0's for reasons in the realm of mathematics and logic. Feel free to look it up, there is a lot of cool information about that.

- A **Binary Digit (Bit)** is well, the each one of those 1's and 0's. Each spot where you can have a digit contains a *bit* so if you have the above  machine language output, that would be 16 **bits**. Now you may be wondering, "Hey I have heard of a **Byte**, is that the same as a *bit*?" Good question!

- A **Byte** the what you call when you have a collection of 8 *bits*. So if you have the 16 bits of machine language we were talking about earlier, you can alternately say you have 2 **bytes** of machine language. Pretty cool huh? That 500 GB hard drive? 500 * 1,000,000,000 (from the *Giga* part) **bytes** or 500 * 1,000,000,000 * 8 (from the byte part) **bits**!

- A **Transistor** is the the physical representation of the 0 or 1 bit. It is a physical digital *switch*. When it is flipped *ON* (current going through it) it used to mean a *1*, and when it is *OFF* (no current) it represents a *0*.

Phew! Now that that's out of the way, we can starting talking about some really useful and brilliant uses of these things.  Here is a quick visual summary:

## The Six Great Ideas in Computer Architecture
It is now that we come upon the The Six Great Ideas in Computer Architecture (so named due to their greatness). These topics will form the basis for the rest of this guide.

1. **Design processors using [Moore's Law](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Moores_law)** which states processing speed and memory capacity will double every two years; an occurrence that is related to the number of transistors in the chip doubling. It was predicted by Gordon Moore in 1965, and has held roughly true thus far. 
	
2. **Abstract as much as possible in order to simplify the design.** This idea relates to what we talked about in the previous section. Split up the responsibility of understanding your code by using a standardized hierarchy (High Level Language -> Assembly Language -> Machine Level) so that each layer takes in an input and passes it down to the next layer. This process makes it infinitely easier to find out where things went or can go wrong. 

3. **Design so that the most common case is fast.** This one should be rather intuitive. Instead of wasting time, energy, and of course money trying to optimize so that every part of the program (down to the tiny edge cases) is blazing fast, why not  just make the most used cases faster? Otherwise you'll end up with a lot of code that is probably only trivially faster than if you just made the most oftenly used cases faster.

4. **Make dependable systems by using redundancy.** This one is also rather intuitive. Basically you should make backups of the data and repeat the work with other parts of the computer system to ensure everything is accurate and dependable (nothing fails). 

5. **Use the capacities and speeds of different storage systems to make things fast.** This is actually one of the main ideas in this guide. We use this principal to optimize the usage of different kinds of memory (fast vs. slow, big vs. small)  to cleverly and thriftily use the resources and make our programs fast and light. 

6.  **Find ways to improve performance** using techniques such as **Parallelism,  Pipelining, and Prediction**. The techniques will also be discussed in greater detail later on. The basic idea for each is to have multiple parts of the computer to split up the work (**parallelism**), stage the processes so that no part of the computer has the excuse that it wasn't told what to do (**pipelining**),  and lastly try to predict where along the pipeline things might fail and proactively prevent those failures (**prediction**). 

With basically these ideas we have managed to come to where computers are today! Pretty impressive, isn't it?
